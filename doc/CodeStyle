* Style
 - 4 spaces, no tabs
 - up to 80 columns
 - single space around operators
 - indent function arguments on column
 - no spaces in the end-of-line
 
 * Naming convention:
 - lower case, underscores
 - names must begin with ucp/uct/ucs
 - an output argument which is a pointer to a user variable has _p suffix
 - value types (e.g struct types, integer types) have _t suffix
 - pointer to structs, which are used as API handles, have _h suffix
 
 * C++
 - used only for unit testing
 - lower-case class names (same as stl/boost)
 
* Include order:
  1. config.h
  2. specific internal header
  3. ucx headers
  4. system headers

* Doxygen
 - all interface H/C files should have doxygen documentation.
 
* Error handling
 - all internal error codes must be ucs_status_t
 - a function which returns error should print a log message
 - the function which prints the log message is the first one which decides which
   error it is. If a functions returns an error because it's callee returned 
   erroneous ucs_status_t, it does not have to print a log message.
