/**
 * \mainpage Preface
 * 
 * \section Scope Scope of the Document 
 * This document describes the UCX programming
 * interface.  The programming interface exposes a high performance
 * communication API, which provides basic building blocks for programming models such as the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) and the Message
 * Passing Interface (MPI), for Big-Data, Analytics and File I/O applications, and for storage library developers.
 *
 * \section Audience Audience
 * This manual is intended for programmers who want to
 * develop parallel programming models such as OpenSHMEM, MPI, UPC, and Chapel.
 * We assume that the reader is familiar with the following:
 * + Basic concepts of two-sided, one-sided, atomic, and collective operations
 * + C programming language
 *
 * \section Status Document Status 
 * This section briefly describes a list of open
 * issues in the UCX specification.  
 * + UCP API - work in progress 
 * + UCT API - work in progress
 * 
 *
 * \section License 
 * UCX project follows open source development model and the software is
