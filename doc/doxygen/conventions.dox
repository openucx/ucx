/**
 * @page Conventions Conventions and Notations
 * This section describes the conventions and notations in the UCX specification.
 * 
 * \section Blocking Blocking Behavior
 * The blocking UCX routines return only when a UCX operation is complete.
 * After return, the resources used in the UCX routine are available
 * for reuse. 
 * 
 * \section Non-blocking Non-blocking Behavior
 * The non-blocking UCX routines return immediately, independent of operation 
 * completion. After return, the resources used for the routines are not
 * necessarily available for reuse.
 * 
 * \section Fairness Fairness
 * UCX routines do not guarantee fairness. However, the routines 
 * enable UCX consumers to write efficient and fair programs.
