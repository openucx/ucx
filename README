# Unified Communication X

Unified Communication X (UCX) provides an optimized communication
layer for Message Passing ([MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/)),
[PGAS](http://www.pgas.org/)/[OpenSHMEM](http://www.openshmem.org/)
libraries and RPC/data-centric applications.

UCX utilizes high-speed networks for inter-node communication, and
shared memory mechanisms for efficient intra-node communication.

## Using UCX

### Release Builds

Building UCX is typically a combination of running "configure" and "make".
Execute the following commands to install the UCX system from within the
directory at the top of the tree:

```sh
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./contrib/configure-release --prefix=/where/to/install
$ make -j8
$ make install
```

NOTE: Compiling support for various networks or other specific hardware may
require additional command line flags when running configure.

### Developer Builds

```bash
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./contrib/configure-devel --prefix=$PWD/install-debug
```

*** NOTE: Developer builds of UCX typically include a large performance 
penalty at run-time because of extra debugging code.

### Running internal unit tests

```sh
$ make -C test/gtest test
```

### Build RPM package
```bash
$ contrib/buildrpm.sh -s -b
```

### Build DEB package
```bash
$ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
```

### Build Doxygen documentation
```bash
$ make docs
```

### OpenMPI and OpenSHMEM installation with UCX
[Wiki page](http://github.com/openucx/ucx/wiki/OpenMPI-and-OpenSHMEM-installation-with-UCX)

### MPICH installation with UCX
[Wiki page](http://github.com/openucx/ucx/wiki/MPICH-installation-with-UCX)

### UCX Performance Test

Start server:


```sh
$ ./src/tools/perf/ucx_perftest -c 0
```

Connect client:

```sh
$ ./src/tools/perf/ucx_perftest <server-hostname> -t tag_lat -c 0
```

## UCX Architecture

![](doc/doxygen/Architecture.png)

| Component | Role        | Description |
| :---:     | :---:       | ---         |
| UCP | Protocol          | Implements high-level abstractions such as tag-matching, streams, connection negotiation and establishment, multi-rail, and handling different memory types |
| UCT | Transport         | Implements low-level communication primitives such as active messages, remote memory access, and atomic operations |
| UCS | Services          | A collection of data structures, algorithms, and system utilities for common use |
| UCM | Memory            | Intercepts memory allocation and release events, used by the  memory registration cache |
