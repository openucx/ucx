#### Important changes
* If Cuda memory hooks on driver API cannot be installed, memory type cache and
  memory registration cache will be disabled. This may lead to lower performance
  of some applications on setups with NVIDIA GPUs, even if Cuda memory is not
  being used. Prior to this change, failing to install driver API hooks could
  lead to runtime errors or data corruption when Cuda memory is used and linked
  statically with cuda runtime.
  In order to revert to previous behavior (when the application is linked
  dynamically with cuda runtime), the user can set UCX_MEM_CUDA_HOOK_MODE=reloc.
  See more info in https://github.com/openucx/ucx/pull/7865.

- Multiple minor bugfixes (full list on github)
- Segfault fix for a code generated by armclang compiler
- UCP memory-domain index fix for zero-copy active messages

### Tested configurations:
- InfiniBand: MLNX_OFED 4.2-4.4, distribution inbox drivers, rdma-core
- CUDA: gdrcopy 1.2, cuda 9.1.85
- XPMEM: 2.6.2
- KNEM: 1.1.2
- Multiple bugfixes (full list on github)

### Known issues:
#2919 - Segfault in CUDA support when KNEM not present and CMA is active
intra-node RMA transport. As a workaround user can disable CMA support at
compile time: --disable-cma. Alternatively user can remove CMA from UCX_TLS
list, for example: UCX_TLS=mm,rc,cuda_copy,cuda_ipc,gdr_copy.

### Bugfixes:
- Multiple bugfixes (full list on github)

### Tested configurations:
- InfiniBand: MLNX_OFED 4.2, inbox OFED drivers.
- CUDA: gdrcopy 1.2, cuda 9.1.85
- XPMEM: 2.6.2
- KNEM: 1.1.2

### Known issues:
#2047 - UCP: ucp_do_am_bcopy_multi drops data on UCS_ERROR_NO_RESOURCE
#2047 - failure in ud/uct_flush_test.am_zcopy_flush_ep_nb/1
#1977 - failure in shm/test_ucp_rma.blocking_small/0
#1926 - Timeout in mpi_test_suite with HW TM
#1920 - transport retry count exceeded in many-to-one tests
#1689 - Segmentation fault on memory hooks test in jenkins

## 1.2.2 (January 4, 2018)
### Main:
- Support including UCX API headers from C++ code
- UD transport to handle unicast flood on RoCE fabric
- Compilation fixes for gcc 7.1.1, clang 3.6, clang 5

### Details:
- When UD transport is used with RoCE, packets intended for other peers may
  arrive on different adapters (as a result of unicast flooding).
- This change adds packet filtering based on destination GIDs. Now the packet
  is silently dropped, if its destination GID does not match the local GID.
- Added a new device ID for InfiniBand HCA
- [packaging] Move `examples/` and `perftest/` into doc
- [packaging] Update spec to work on old distros while complaint with Fedora
  guidelines
- [cleanup] Removed unused ptmalloc version (2.83)
- [cleanup] Fixup license headers
