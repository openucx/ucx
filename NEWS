#### Important changes
* If Cuda memory hooks on driver API cannot be installed, memory type cache and
  memory registration cache will be disabled. This may lead to lower performance
  of some applications on setups with NVIDIA GPUs, even if Cuda memory is not
  being used. Prior to this change, failing to install driver API hooks could
  lead to runtime errors or data corruption when Cuda memory is used and linked
  statically with cuda runtime.
  In order to revert to previous behavior (when the application is linked
  dynamically with cuda runtime), the user can set UCX_MEM_CUDA_HOOK_MODE=reloc.
