## 1.2.2 (January 4, 2018)
### Main:
- Support including UCX API headers from C++ code
- UD transport to handle unicast flood on RoCE fabric
- Compilation fixes for gcc 7.1.1, clang 3.6, clang 5

### Details:
- When UD transport is used with RoCE, packets intended for other peers may
  arrive on different adapters (as a result of unicast flooding).
- This change adds packet filtering based on destination GIDs. Now the packet
  is silently dropped, if its destination GID does not match the local GID.
- Added a new device ID for InfiniBand HCA
- [packaging] Move `examples/` and `perftest/` into doc
- [packaging] Update spec to work on old distros while complaint with Fedora
  guidelines
- [cleanup] Removed unused ptmalloc version (2.83)
