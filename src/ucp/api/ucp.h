 * segment, the routine allocates a mapped memory segment and returns its

 * application context can typically send and receive data from the mapped
 * memory without CPU intervention; some devices and associated network stacks
 * require the memory to be mapped to send and receive data. The @ref ucp_mem_h
 * "memory handle" includes all information required to access the memory
 * locally using UCP routines, while @ref ucp_rkey_h
 * "remote registration handle" provides an information that is necessary for
 * remote memory access.
 *
 * @note
 * Another well know terminology for the "map" operation that is typically
 * used in the context of networking is memory "registration" or "pinning". The
 * UCP library registers the memory the available hardware so it can be
 * assessed directly by the hardware.
 *
 * Memory mapping assumptions:
 * @li A given memory segment can be mapped by several different communication
 * stacks, if these are compatible.
 * @li The @a memh_p handle returned may be used with any sub-region of the
 * mapped memory.
 * @li If a large segment is registered, and then segmented for subsequent use

/**
 * @ingroup UCP_COMM
 * @brief Post an atomic fetch operation.
 *
 * This routine will post an atomic fetch operation to remote memory.
 * The remote value is described by the combination of the remote
 * memory address @a remote_addr and the @ref ucp_rkey_h "remote memory handle"
 * @a rkey.
 * The routine is non-blocking and therefore returns immediately. However the
 * actual atomic operation may be delayed. The atomic operation is not considered complete
 * until the values in remote and local memory are completed. If the atomic operation
 * completes immediately, the routine returns UCS_OK and the call-back routine
 * @a cb is @b not invoked. If the operation is @b not completed immediately and no
 * error is reported, then the UCP library will schedule invocation of the call-back
 * routine @a cb upon completion of the atomic operation. In other words, the completion
 * of an atomic operation can be signaled by the return code or execution of the call-back.
 *
 * @note The user should not modify any part of the @a result after this
 *       operation is called, until the operation completes.
 *
 * @param [in] ep          UCP endpoint.
 * @param [in] opcode      One of @ref ucp_atomic_fetch_op_t.
 * @param [in] value       Source operand for atomic operation. In the case of CSWAP
 *                         this is the conditional for the swap. For SWAP this is
 *                         the value to be placed in remote memory.
 * @param [inout] result   Local memory address to store resulting fetch to.
 *                         In the case of CSWAP the value in result will be
 *                         swapped into the @a remote_addr if the condition
 *                         is true.
 * @param [in] op_size     Size of value in bytes and pointer type for result
 * @param [in] remote_addr Remote address to operate on.
 * @param [in] rkey        Remote key handle for the remote memory address.
 * @param [in] cb          Call-back function that is invoked whenever the
 *                         send operation is completed. It is important to note
 *                         that the call-back function is only invoked in a case when
 *                         the operation cannot be completed in place.
 *
 * @return NULL                 - The operation was completed immediately.
 * @return UCS_PTR_IS_ERR(_ptr) - The operation failed.
 * @return otherwise            - Operation was scheduled and can be
 *                              completed at any point in time. The request handle

 *                              progress of the operation. The application is
 *                              responsible for releasing the handle using
