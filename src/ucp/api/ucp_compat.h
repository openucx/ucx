/**
 * @ingroup UCP_WORKER
 * @brief Add user defined callback for Active Message.
 *
 * This routine installs a user defined callback to handle incoming Active
 * Messages with a specific id. This callback is called whenever an Active
 * Message that was sent from the remote peer by @ref ucp_am_send_nb is
 * received on this worker.
 *
 * @param [in]  worker      UCP worker on which to set the Active Message
 *                          handler.
 * @param [in]  id          Active Message id.
 * @param [in]  cb          Active Message callback. NULL to clear.
 * @param [in]  arg         Active Message argument, which will be passed
 *                          in to every invocation of the callback as the
 *                          arg argument.
 * @param [in]  flags       Dictates how an Active Message is handled on the
 *                          remote endpoint. Currently only
 *                          UCP_AM_FLAG_WHOLE_MSG is supported, which
 *                          indicates the callback will not be invoked
 *                          until all data has arrived.
 *
 * @return error code if the worker does not support Active Messages or
 *         requested callback flags.
