 * @ingroup UCT_API
 * @{
 * Defines client-server operations.
 * The client-server API allows the connection establishment between an active
 * side - a client, and its peer - the passive side - a server.
 * The connection can be established through a UCT transport that supports
 * listening and connecting via IP address and port (listening can also be on INADDR_ANY).
 *
 * The following is a general overview of the operations on the server side:
 *
 * Connecting:
 * @ref uct_cm_open
 *      Open a connection manager.
 * @ref uct_listener_create
 *      Create a listener on the CM and start listening on a given IP,port / INADDR_ANY.
 * @ref uct_listener_conn_request_callback_t
 *      This callback is invoked by the UCT transport to handle an incoming connection
 *      request from a client.
 *      Accept or reject the client's connection request.
 * @ref uct_ep_create
 *      Connect to the client by creating an endpoint in case of accepting its request.
 *      The server creates a new endpoint per every connection request that it accepts.
 * @ref uct_sockaddr_priv_pack_callback_t
 *      This callback is invoked by the UCT transport to fill auxiliary data in
 *      the connection acknowledgement or reject notification back to the client.
 *      Send the client a connection acknowledgement or reject notification.
 *      Wait for an acknowledgment from the client, indicating that it is connected.
 * @ref uct_ep_server_connect_cb_t
 *      This callback is invoked by the UCT transport to handle the connection
 *      acknowledgment from the client.
 *
 * Disconnecting:
 * @ref uct_ep_disconnect
 *      Disconnect the server's endpoint from the client.
 *      Can be called when initiating a disconnect or when receiving a disconnect
 *      notification from the remote side.
 * @ref uct_ep_disconnect_cb_t
 *      This callback is invoked by the UCT transport when the client side calls
 *      uct_ep_disconnect as well.
 * @ref uct_ep_destroy
 *      Destroy the endpoint connected to the remote peer.
 *      If this function is called before the endpoint was disconnected, the
 *      @ref uct_ep_disconnect_cb_t will not be invoked.
 *
 * Destroying the server's resources:
 * @ref uct_listener_destroy
 *      Destroy the listener object.
 * @ref uct_cm_close
 *      Close the connection manager.
 *
 * The following is a general overview of the operations on the client side:
 *
 * Connecting:
 * @ref uct_cm_open
 *      Open a connection manager.
 * @ref uct_ep_create
 *      Create an endpoint for establishing a connection to the server.
 * @ref uct_sockaddr_priv_pack_callback_t
 *      This callback is invoked by the UCT transport to fill the user's private data
 *      in the connection request to be sent to the server. This connection request
 *      should be created by the transport.
 *      Send the connection request to the server.
 *      Wait for an acknowledgment from the server, indicating that it is connected.
 * @ref uct_ep_client_connect_cb_t
 *      This callback is invoked by the UCT transport to handle a connection response
 *      from the server.
 *      After invoking this callback, the UCT transport will finalize the client's
 *      connection to the server.
 *
 * Disconnecting:
 * @ref uct_ep_disconnect
 *      Disconnect the client's endpoint from the server.
 *      Can be called when initiating a disconnect or when receiving a disconnect
 *      notification from the remote side.
 * @ref uct_ep_disconnect_cb_t
 *      This callback is invoked by the UCT transport when the server side calls
 *      uct_ep_disconnect as well.
 * @ref uct_ep_destroy
 *      Destroy the endpoint connected to the remote peer.
 *
 * Destroying the client's resources:
 * @ref uct_cm_close
 *      Close the connection manager.
