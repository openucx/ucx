  *
  * UCG group is an opaque object representing a set of connected remote workers.
  * This object is used for collective operations - like the ones defined by the
  * Message Passing Interface (MPI). Groups are created with respect to a local
  * worker, and share its endpoints for communication with the remote workers.

  * @brief UCG collective operation handle
  *
  * UCG collective is an opaque object representing a description of a collective
  * operation. Much like in object-oriented paradigms, a collective is like a
  * "class" which can be instantiated - an instance would be a UCG request to
  * perform this collective operation once. The description holds all the
  * necessary information to perform collectives, so re-starting an operation
  * requires no additional parameters.

 * UCG groups have multiple peers: remote worker objects acting as group members.
 * Each group member, including the local worker which was used to create the
 * group, has an unique identifier within the group - an integer between 0 and
 * the number of peers in it. The same worker may have different identifiers
 * in different groups, identifiers which are passed by user during creation.
